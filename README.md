# dotfiles


# Fresh Install

Installing on a fresh system from the ~ directory:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:maddenpj/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles && ./install
```

# Updating

Just update config files as usual (`vim .vimrc`) but make sure to commit and push the changes

`install` is Idempotent so re-running it should not be an issue
